<b>SVM was the best algorithm in this case of terrain data as what I have found.</b> <br>
<b>If we consider only the three algorithms mentioned below -> </b><br>
  <ul>
    <li>Adaboost </li>
    <li>Random Forest </li>
    <li>K Nearest Neighbours</li>
  </ul>
<b>The best accuracy was found from K Nearest Neighbours with some parameter-tuning</b>
